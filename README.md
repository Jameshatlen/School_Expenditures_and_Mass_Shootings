Expenditures per Pupil for Elementary and Secondary Public Schools

This indicator represents the amount that local, state, and federal governments spend on elementary and secondary education, adjusted for the size of the student body. It is calculated by dividing the current expenditures over the entire academic year for prekindergarten through grade 12 by the number of students in those grades in public schools. Current expenditures include instruction and instruction-related costs, student support services, administration, and operations and exclude funds for school construction and other capital outlays, debt service, and programs outside of public elementary and secondary education.
